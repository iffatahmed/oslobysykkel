# Oslo City Bikes web app
This is a small web application that fetches real time data from the open API about Oslo City Bike. It shows the stations and respective bikes/docks status via textual list as well on the Map. 

It has two HTML and two JS files, both for home page and for map page.

It uses SASS compiler, however compiled CSS is also included in the github repo, so you just need to download the code repo and run index file to view the app.
